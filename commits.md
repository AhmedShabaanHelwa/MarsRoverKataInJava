| Add project and .gitignore files                                                                                                               |
| Feature 1: Print Initial State. Cycle 1: Red: Create MarsRoverShould class and Add test to print initial state 0:0:N.                          |
| Feature 1: Print Initial State. Cycle 2: Green: Add MarsRover class and introduce minimal change to print initial state.                       |
| Feature 1: Print Initial State. Mini cycle: Triangulating initial positions to include centric and non-centric initial positions.              |
| Feature 1: Print Initial State. Cycle 3: Refactor: Move MarsRover class to a separate file and move to main project.                           |
| Feature 1: Print Initial State. Cycle 2&3: Introduce initialState field in MarsRover .                                                         |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Cycle 1: Red: Add test to move forward one step from center towards north (Y) direction.                              |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Cycle 2: Green:  Introduce minimal change for MarsRover.execute() function to move one step forward.                  |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Mini cycle: Triangulating moveForward test to accept different initial and final states (North only).                 |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Cycle 3: Refactor: compute the position of one move forward in north instead of hardcoding.                           |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Mini cycle: Triangulating moveForward test to accept different initial and final states for all remaining directions. |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Cycle 2: Green:  Introduce minimal change for MarsRover.execute() function to move forward in all directions.         |
| Feature 2: Move Forward. Cycle 3: Refactor: Fix primitive obsession code smell by introducing a Position object-value                          |
